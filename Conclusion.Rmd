# Conclusion

The research sought to discover whether another financial variable, treasury implied volatility (YIV), can predict macroeconomic real activity (more specifically the growth rate of GDP). Through replicating the research conducted by @Cremers2021, we validate our first hypothesis that YIV indeed is a significant predictor of macroeconomic real activity. Furthermore, we validated that the variable is robust even after controlling for many existing relevant predictors. 
Secondly, we accept our second hypothesis that the model based on full sample is inefficient in predicting GDP during turbulent periods - this is because business cycle-related asymmetries exist. As mentioned in the results, having calculated 2 business cycle dependent RMSFE’s (in addition to the general RMSFE), we can clearly note that the RMSFE is higher during the recessionary period, no matter the model used.
Finally, we proceed to combat the shortcomings of the linear model with the aim to improve forecast accuracy. For that, we turn our focus on the machine learning (ML) based method, more specifically the random forest (RF) model, which has proven to combat one of the key shortcomings of the linear model – the ability to account for non-linearities. Through implementing the random forest model we indeed find confirmation to our third hypothesis that using the model we are able to improve the forecasting accuracy measured through the root mean square forecasting error (RMSFE) - furthermore, this result can be generalized to both expansionary and recessionary subsamples. Furthermore, plotting the RF model against the benchmark linear model in terms of CSSFED yields an upward sloping graph, validating our results that the RF model consistently outperforms the linear model.
