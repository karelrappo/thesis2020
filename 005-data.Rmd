# Data

For the regression analysis, we (have) extract(ed) the following data:

* Quarterly 5-year Treasury Implied Volatility 
* Dependent Variables:
  1. Quarterly GDP year-on-year growth rate
  2. Monthly industrial production
  3. Monthly non-farm payroll
  4. Monthly consumption
* Control Variables
  5. US treasury interest rates to construct term spreads
  6. credit spreads
  7. stock returns
  8. stock market implied volatility
  9. Housing Starts

As mentioned in the review of literature, YIV is constructed using Black model & deriving implied volatility through option prices, time-to-maturity, etc. The data regarding options on treasury bond futures, however, is collected by CME and available only through accessing their database.

Due to the data price being behind the paywall, we had to resort to other measures to access the data. Firstly, we contacted prof. Cremers, Gandhi & Fleckenstein, who were ready to share their data with us if the CME group gives their consent. Nevertheless, as the work is still in the publication process, we could not rely solely on that possibility, and thus resort to other options - extracting data via plot digitizers (read more in Appendix A.)


The data regarding GDP year-on-year growth rate was extracted on a quarterly basis from @Alfred2020. Furthermore, the vintage 2019-12-20 was extracted as it coincided the best with the data used in the research paper by @Cremers2017. Other dependent variables (industrial production, non-farm payroll and consumption) & housing data was extracted from the same database but on a monthly basis. 
The data for risk free rates that will be used in constructing term spreads was extracted from the dataset of The Federal Reserve Board working paper. [@Gurkaynak2011]
